# election-analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to find the winner of the elections by candidate name and by county. Performing this analysis helped us understand how to pull information from a .csv file to perform analysis on the data.

## Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

* There were 369,711 votes casted in this congressional election.
---

*County Votes:

Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)

Denver: 82.8% (306,055)

Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

* The county with the largest number of votes was Denver.

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.


* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
This script can be use in the future to perform other elections analysis by just rewriting to pull the information requested. In the future, one way this can be done is by changing the paths on the code to the new .csv file to make sure we pull the correct data. Also, we can rewrite the code to provide us with different information such as adding poulation of each county to compare the real voter turnout.
